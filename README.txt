1) Make sure you have all electronic components in Schematic:
+STM32F407 discovery
+Sd card (attention: card speed must be bigger than MCU speed)-Check my CUBEMX
+3-Relay in my project.
+Module RFID RC522
+Module R305 figerprint
+....Check in schematic.
2) I have the code of ESP,to send character from ESP to STM through UART.
